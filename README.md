**Captcha Breaker**
<p>This project is intended as an academic exercise. 
We have used convolutional neural networks and computer vision for recognizing a fixed length text CAPTCHA. We have trained our network model on fixed length CAPTCHAs and were able to get significant accuracy levels by employing the principle of training the model for individual character recognition.
<p> 
**Restricitions**:
<p>Currently,this preview build is able to functionally evaluate captchas with charachter sequences containing exactly 4 charachters.
Also,the current version is unable to distinguish between O and 0 as well as I and 1 due to the similarity of features between these charachters.
